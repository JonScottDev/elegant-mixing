Elegant mixing is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interface that allows a user to make a request to the cocktail DB API and which serves the client-side popular drink recipes. 

## Optimizations

- CHANGES I WOULD MAKE </br>
I need to go back and refactor my code. It is a bit "wet" and I believe there are areas to reduce the amount of code.

- THINGS YOU WANT TO ADD </br>
I would like to add a way for users to store their previous searches in case they come back to the website at a later date. I would do this with localStorage
